# EnsembleLearningExercises
Exercises done during the discipline of Ensemble Learning (PhD graduation)

# Exercise01
This is a evaluation of Bagging algorithm in two UCI data sets. Three classifiers are used: Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors
and Multi Layer Perceptrons.

# Exercise03
This is a comparison evaluation between Bagging and a ensemble pruning method called EPIC (Ensemble Pruning via Individual Contribution Ordering).
